## Introduction of mmWave Communication
### Sub-6 GHz
Sub 6 GHz is a term used to refer to the frequency range below 6 GHz in the radio spectrum. This frequency range is used to provide wireless services such as 4G, LTE, 5G and WiFi.

The main advantage of sub-6 is that it can carry more data than signals in the 2.4 GHz range. That’s because there’s more room in the sub-6 spectrum for data to travel.

Sub-6GHz is also less susceptible to interference than the 2.4 GHz range. That’s because the sub-6 spectrum is less crowded than the 2.4 GHz range. There are fewer devices that use sub-6, so there’s less chance of interference.

The downside of sub-6 is that it doesn’t travel as far as signals in the 2.4 GHz range. That’s because the higher frequency waves don’t penetrate walls and other obstacles as well as lower frequency waves.

### RF-ADC and RF-DAC
