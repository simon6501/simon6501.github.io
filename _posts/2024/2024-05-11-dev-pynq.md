## Introduction
To empower the convenience of developing on PYNQ-Z2, we need to configure the development environment first. This post will guide you through the process of setting up the development environment for PYNQ-Z2, especially for Windows + Linux dual system.

## Configuration of environment - Windows + WSL2
### 1. Install WSL2 (can be skipped if already installed)
Download the WSL2 installer from [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wsl2) and install it.

### 2. Install Ubuntu on WSL2
Open Microsoft Store and search for Ubuntu. Install the specific version you want. For example, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is installed in this post because Vivado 2022.2 is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. The requirement of Ubuntu version for Vivado 2022.2 can be found in [Vivado 2022.2 Release Notes](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2022_2/ug973-vivado-release-notes-install-license.pdf).
Check the log in the terminal to see if the installation is successful. If not, try to restart the computer or change BIOS settings. For example, enabling the virtualization technology in ASUS BIOS can refer to [ASUS FAQ](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1008829/).
If GUI is needed, the configuration can refer to [GUI Configuration](https://medium.com/@japheth.yates/the-complete-wsl2-gui-setup-2582828f4577). Although it is not recommended to use GUI in WSL2, it is still possible to use it.

### 3. Install Vivado 2022.2 on Ubuntu
Download the Vivado 2022.2 installer from [Xilinx website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive.html). Remember to choose the correct version for linux. The downloaded bin file is located in `\mnt\d\..` folder.

The installation process can be found in [Vivado Installation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uJzjvgTQUk). Remember to install the cable drivers and load license after the installation no matter Vivado is installed on Windows or Ubuntu. After the installation, for Ubuntu, add the 'source settings' to the profile file, which can lead to eaiser access to Vivado. The command to open Vivado can be found in the terminal by typing `vivado`. The command can automatically open Vivado GUI without the need to navigate to the installation folder. I also installed Vivado on Windows, but this is just for locally testing the FPGA board.

### 4. Setup PYNQ-Z2
The guide for setting up PYNQ-Z2 can be found in [PYNQ-Z2 Setup Guide](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/pynq_z2_setup.html). The brief steps are as follows:
- Download the PYNQ-Z2 image and write it to the SD card
- Connect PYNQ-Z2 to the PC via USB
- Connect one side of Ethernet cable to PYNQ-Z2 and the other side to the router LAN
- Connect the WAN port of the router to the network and another LAN port to the PC
- Power on the PYNQ-Z2 and wait for the booting process
- Open the browser and navigate to `http://pynq:9090` to access the Jupyter notebook with pws `xilinx` (or use the IP address)
- Change the hostname and reboot the PYNQ-Z2
- Download the board files from [PYNQ-Z2 board files](https://github.com/xupsh/pynq-supported-board-file)
- The board files can be added to Vivado by copying the files to the `\Xilinx\Vivado\2022.2\data\boards\board_files`
- Download the master constraint file from [PYNQ-Z2 master constraint file](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2440950)

Two tests can be done to check if the setup is successful:
- Open the Jupyter notebook and run the test notebook
The test code can be found in [PYNQ-Z2 test code](https://blog.umer-farooq.com/a-pynq-z2-guide-for-absolute-dummies-part-i-fun-with-leds-and-switches-47dd76abf9a9)

- Open the Windows Vivado 2022.2 and connect to the PYNQ-Z2 board
This is the most important step to check if the setup of the board is successful and the connection between the PC and the board is established.

There are several possible bugs that may occur during the setup process. 

For example, the driver for the USB cable may not be installed correctly. The driver can be found in the Vivado installation folder. For example, the folder of USB driver for PYNQ-Z2 can be found in `\Xilinx\Vivado\2022.2\data\xicom\cable_drivers\nt64\digilent\install_digilent.exe`. The driver can be re-installed by running the `install_digilent.exe` file if the USB cable is not recognized by the PC. It can also be tested by using Putty to connect to the PYNQ-Z2 via USB. The connection can be established by using the COM port and the baud rate of 115200, which can be found in PYNQ-Z2 setup guide.

The Vivado may not be able to detect the PYNQ-Z2 board inside hardware manager (at least not working for me). The solution is introduced below.

### 5. Configure FPGA from remote server with Hardware Server
Because the FPGA board is connected to the local PC via USB, the Vivado Lab Edition installed on Windows can be used to program the FPGA while the Vivado installed on Ubuntu is used to generate the bitstream.

Download and install Vivado Lab Edition and open the hardware server. Open Vivado Lab 2022.2 Tcl Shell and type `hw_server` to start the hardware server. After that, the server is launched and the connection between the PC and the FPGA board is established. After the bitstream is generated in Ubuntu, the bitstream can be programmed to the FPGA via the hardware server. Click `Open Target` in the hardware manager and type the hostname displayed in Windows Tcl Shell or the IP address to connect to the hardware server. The FPGA board can be detected and the bitstream can be programmed to the FPGA.

In contrast, the way to program and test the FPGA on Linux can refer to [Blog page](https://www.controlpaths.com/2021/11/08/remote-debugging-via-hardware-server/) (not tested).

## Configuration of environment - Windows + Ubuntu Remote Server
### 1. Install Ubuntu on a remote server

### 2. Install XServer and PuTTY on Windows
Install XMing and XMing-fonts as well as PuTTY on Windows. The configuration of PuTTY can be found in [PuTTY Configuration](https://laptops.eng.uci.edu/engineering-software/using-linux/how-to-configure-putty-xming-on-your-laptop).

### 3. Install Vivado 2022.2 on Ubuntu
The installation process is the same as the one in the Windows + WSL2 section. The only difference is that the Vivado is installed on the remote server. 

But when there is bug like Vivado installation got stuck with "Generating installed devices list", the solution can be found in [Vivado Installation Stuck](https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006hpQNASA2/vivado-installation-got-stuck-says-generating-installed-devices-list?language=en_US).

### 4. Setup PYNQ-Z2
The setup process is the same as the one in the Windows + WSL2 section.

### 5. Configure FPGA from remote server with Hardware Server
The setup process is the same as the one in the Windows + WSL2 section.
