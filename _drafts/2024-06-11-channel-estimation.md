The equation $$ \hat{h} = (x^T x)^{-1} x^T y $$ represents the least squares (LS) estimation method for finding the channel $$ h $$ in a linear system model. Let's break down the components and understand the context given in the note.

#### Linear System Model
The general form of the linear system model is given by:
$$ y = hx + n $$
where:
- $$ y $$ is the received signal.
- $$ h $$ is the channel or the parameter we want to estimate.
- $$ x $$ is the transmitted signal.
- $$ n $$ is the noise.

#### Least Squares Estimation
The least squares estimation method aims to find the estimate $$ \hat{h} $$ that minimizes the squared difference between the observed values $$ y $$ and the predicted values $$ hx $$. The least squares solution is given by:
$$ \hat{h} = (x^T x)^{-1} x^T y $$

#### Explanation of the Components
- $$ x^T $$: The transpose of the matrix $$ x $$.
- $$ x^T x $$: The product of $$ x^T $$ and $$ x $$, resulting in a square matrix.
- $$ (x^T x)^{-1} $$: The inverse of the matrix $$ x^T x $$ . This exists only if $$ x^T x $$ is invertible.
- $$ x^T y $$: The product of the transpose of $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.

#### Intuition
1. **Transposing and Multiplying $$ x $$**: By transposing $$ x $$ and multiplying it by itself ($$ x^T x $$), we are constructing a matrix that encapsulates the relationships among the elements of $$ x $$. This helps in capturing the variance and correlation structure of $$ x $$.

2. **Multiplying with $$ y $$**: Multiplying the transpose of $$ x $$ with $$ y $$  ($$ x^T y $$) projects the received signal $$ y $$ onto the space spanned by the columns of $$ x $$.

3. **Inverting the Matrix**: The matrix $$ (x^T x)^{-1} $$  adjusts for the scaling and correlation in the data $$ x $$, ensuring that we get an unbiased estimate of $$ h $$.

#### Context in the Note
The note indicates this process in the context of 2G GSM and 4G LTE communications. Specifically:

2G GSM: It uses a training sequence (26 bits) for channel estimation.

4G LTE: It employs a grid of resource blocks where each block is used for channel estimation in both time and frequency domains.

In the case of 2G GSM, the least squares estimation could be used to estimate the channel based on the known training sequence, where the data $$ x $$ represents the known training bits and $$ y $$ represents the received signal during this training period.

#### Practical Issues
The note also mentions practical issues like:

Pilot Contamination: Interference from pilots in other cells. This is especially relevant in the context of **massive MIMO** systems.

Synchronization & PLL: Phase-locked loops for synchronizing the receiver.

Timing Recovery: Ensuring proper alignment of symbols in time.

TDD/FDD: Different duplexing methods (Time Division Duplexing/Frequency Division Duplexing) affect channel estimation strategies.

## Introduction of MIMO
### FD-MIMO
FD stands for Full Dimension. Therefore, FD-MIMO stands for Full Dimension MIMO. It means the antenna system that can form a beam (beams) in both horizontal and vertical direction so that it can cover (focus on) anywhere in 3D spaces. Following illustration would shows you a comparative picture between FD and conventional multi-antenna system.

CSI (Channel State Information) is the key to the FD-MIMO system. It is used to form a beam in the desired direction.

### MU-MIMO

#### Downlink (D.L.)
In the downlink, the base station transmits signals to multiple users. The signal model is given by:
$$ y = HWx + n $$. Importantly, $$ W $$ needs feedback of $$ \hat{H} $$ (estimated channel matrix) for effective precoding.

#### Uplink (U.L.)
In the uplink, multiple users transmit signals to the base station. The signal model is given by:
$$ y = W(Hx + n) $$. $$ W $$ requires synchronization, timing, and training for effective decoding.

#### Additional Points
- **Schedule Far Apart Users**: It's advantageous to schedule users that are spatially far apart to reduce interference and improve performance.
- **Narrowband**: In narrowband communications, it's necessary to have one $$ \hat{H} $$ (channel estimate) for each subcarrier in OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing).

### Beamspace MIMO
- The strong path loss of wave propagation at mmWave frequencies necessitates the infrastructure basestations (BSs) to acquire accurate channel state information (CSI) in order to perform data detection in the uplink (UEs transmit to BS) and MU precoding in the downlink (BS transmits to UEs). 
- To optimally determine the beamforming weights, accurate CSI is not only of paramount importance for hybrid analog-digital BS architectures but also for emerging all-digital BS architectures.

#### Sparsity-based Channel Estimation
Compressive sensing (CS)-based methods like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The majority of such methods uses a discretization procedure of the number of propagation paths that can be resolved in the beamspace (or angular) domain, which results in a problem widely known as basis mismatch. To avoid the basis mismatch problem, sparse channel estimation for mmWave channels can, for example, be accomplished with atomic norm minimization (ANM) or Newtonized OMP. 

Another strain of sparsity-exploiting channel-estimation methods build upon approximate message passing (AMP). While such methods promise high estimation accuracy, they suffer from a number of drawbacks when implemented in VLSI.

### Hybrid Beamforming Architecture
Due to the limited physical space with closely placed antennas and prohibitive power consumption in mmWave massive MIMO systems, it is difficult to equip a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna. To reduce complexity and cost, phase shifter based two-stage architecture, usually called hybrid architecture, is widely used at both the transmitter and the receiver to connect a large number of antennas with much fewer RF chains.

### MIMO-OFDM
Orthogonality of Functions: Two mathematical functions are orthogonal when the definite integral of their product is zero.

And the recovery of the OFDM signal is done by the DFT/IDFT operation, which is illustrated in the following figure.

#### Frequency-selective Channel Fading and Delay Spread
- Frequency-selective fading: The channel response varies with frequency.
- Delay spread: The time difference between the arrival of the first and last multipath components. The common metric to measure it is the standard deviation of the delay spread called RMS delay spread.

#### Coherence Time and Coherence Bandwidth
- Coherence Time: The time duration over which the channel remains constant.
- Coherence Bandwidth: The bandwidth over which the channel remains constant. All frequencies within the coherence bandwidth experience the same channel response and will fade simultaneously. The coherence bandwidth is inversely proportional to the delay spread.

#### QAM
A QAM modulator works like a translator, helping to translate digital packets into an analog signal to transfer data seamlessly.

QAM is used to achieve high levels of spectrum usage efficiency. This is accomplished by utilizing both the amplitude and phase components to provide a form of modulation. In this scenario, the QAM signal comes with two carriers. Each has the same frequency but differs in phases by 90 degrees, or one-quarter of a cycle, which is the basis for the term quadrature.

One signal is called the I signal, and the other is called the Q signal. Mathematically, one of the signals can be represented with a sine wave and the other by a cosine wave. The two modulated carriers combine at the source for transmission.

The 16-QAM constellation diagram is shown below.

In digital signal modulation, a constellation diagram is typically used to represent a two-dimensional QAM modulation graph. Compared with IQ modulation, the constellation diagram maps data modulation information (including amplitude and phase information about signals) to polar coordinates.

Each constellation point represents a symbol. Components of a point on the I and Q axises represent the amplitude adjustment of orthogonal carriers. The distance A from the point to the origin (0,0) represents the amplitude after modulation, and the angle Ï† of the point represents the phase after modulation.

#### MMSE Equalizer
MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) is a model that minimize the MSE (Mean Square Error) of the received data. The Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) equalizer is a linear equalization technique used in digital communication systems to mitigate the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise. The MMSE equalizer is designed to minimize the mean squared error between the transmitted signal and the equalized received signal.
 
In the context of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system, let's consider the following linear equation representing the received signal Y, transmitted signal X, channel matrix H, and noise vector N:

$$ Y = H * X + N $$
 
The goal of the MMSE equalizer is to find an equalization matrix W_mmse that minimizes the mean squared error between the transmitted signal X and the equalized received signal W_mmse * Y:

$$ W_{mmse} = argmin ||X - W_{mmse} * Y||^2 $$
 
In contrast to the Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer, which only focuses on inverting the channel matrix H to eliminate ISI, the MMSE equalizer balances the elimination of ISI with controlling the noise amplification. This is achieved by minimizing the mean squared error between the transmitted and equalized signals, which considers both the ISI and the noise. This makes the MMSE equalizer more robust to noise compared to the ZF equalizer.
 
The MMSE equalizer matrix can be computed as follows:

$$ W_{mmse} = H^T * (H H^T + N0 I)^{-1} $$

where $$ H^T $$ is the Hermitian (conjugate) transpose of H, N0 is the noise power and I is the identity matrix. Note that the noise power N0 is an important factor in the MMSE equalization process, as it helps to balance the trade-off between ISI suppression and noise amplification.
 
The MMSE equalizer generally outperforms the ZF equalizer in noisy environments, as it aims to minimize the overall mean squared error, taking both ISI and noise into account. However, the MMSE equalizer is more computationally complex due to the need to estimate the noise power and compute the matrix inversion.
 
Finally we can get the estimated Tx signal X from $$ W_mmse $$ and $$ Y $$(recieved signal) as follows:

$$ X_{est} = W_{mmse} * Y $$

#### Preamble-based Channel Estimation

#### Pilot-based Channel Estimation
There are two types of pilot-based channel estimation: block-type and comb-type. The block-type pilot-based channel estimation is used in the time domain, while the comb-type pilot-based channel estimation is used in the frequency domain.

The common estimators are LS (Least Square) and LMMSE (Linear Minimum Mean Square Error).
