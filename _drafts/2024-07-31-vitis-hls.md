## [HLS Streams](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls/Using-HLS-Streams)

To use hls::stream<> objects in your code include the header file **hls_stream.h** as shown below. Streaming data objects are defined by specifying the type and variable name. In this example, a 128-bit unsigned integer type is defined and used to create a stream variable called my_wide_stream.

```c
#include "ap_int.h"
#include "hls_stream.h"

typedef ap_uint<128> uint128_t;  // 128-bit user defined type
hls::stream<uint128_t> my_wide_stream;  // A stream declaration
```
Streams must use scoped naming. AMD recommends using the scoped **hls::** naming shown in the example above. However, if you want to use the hls namespace, you can rewrite the preceding example as:
    
```c
#include <ap_int.h>
#include <hls_stream.h>
using namespace hls;

typedef ap_uint<128> uint128_t;  // 128-bit user defined type
stream<uint128_t> my_wide_stream;  // hls:: no longer required
```

Given a stream specified as hls::stream<T>, the type T can be:

- Any C++ native data type
- A Vitis HLS arbitrary precision type (for example, ap_int<>, ap_ufixed<>)
- A user-defined struct containing either of the above types

A stream can also be specified as **hls::stream<Type, Depth>**, where Depth indicates the depth of the FIFO needed in the verification adapter that the HLS tool creates for RTL co-simulation.

There are Blocking API and Non-blocking API for stream operations.

### [Arbitrary Precision Data Types](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls/Advantages-of-AP-Data-Types)
> One disadvantage of AP data types is that arrays are not automatically initialized with a value of 0. You must manually initialize the array if desired.

#### ap_int
Not good data types for synthesis:
```c
typedef char dinA_t;
typedef short dinB_t;
typedef int dinC_t;
typedef long long dinD_t;
typedef int dout1_t;
typedef unsigned int dout2_t;
typedef int32_t dout3_t;
typedef int64_t dout4_t;
```

Better data types for synthesis:
```c
typedef int6 dinA_t;
typedef int12 dinB_t;
typedef int22 dinC_t;
typedef int33 dinD_t;
typedef int18 dout1_t;
typedef uint13 dout2_t;
typedef int22 dout3_t;
typedef int6 dout4_t;
```

The synthesis results show an improvement to the maximum clock frequency, the latency and a significant reduction in area of 75%. Using **AP** data types, rather than force fitting the design into standard C/C++ data types, results in a higher quality hardware implementation: the same accuracy with better performance with fewer resources.

For the C++ language ap_\[u\]int data types the header file ap_int.h defines the arbitrary precision integer data type. To use arbitrary precision integer data types in a C++ function:
- Add header file **ap_int.h** to the source code.
- Change the bit types to **ap_int<N>** or **ap_uint<N>**, where N is a bit-size from 1 to 1024. 'u' in ap_uint<N> stands for unsigned.

#### ap_fixed
Fixed-point data types model the data as an integer and fraction bits in two's complement with the format ap_fixed<W,I,[Q,O,N]> as explained in the following table. In the following example, the Vitis HLS **ap_fixed** type is used to define an 18-bit variable with 6 bits (including the sign bit) specified as representing the numbers above the binary point, and 12 bits implied to represent the fractional value after the decimal point. The variable is specified as signed and the quantization mode is set to round to plus infinity. Because the overflow mode is not specified, the default wrap-around mode is used for overflow.
```c
#include <ap_fixed.h>
...
ap_fixed<18,6,AP_RND> t1 = 1.5; // internally represented as 0b00'0001.1000'0000'0000 (0x01800)
ap_fixed<18.6,AP_RND> t2 = -1.5; // 0b11'1110.1000'0000'0000 (0x3e800)
...
```

Quantization mode: This dictates the behavior when greater precision is generated than can be defined by smallest fractional bit in the variable used to store the result. AP_RND: Round to plus infinity.

> Important: ROM Synthesis can take a long time when using ap_\[u\]fixed. Changing it to int results in a quicker synthesis. For example:
```c
static ap_fixed<32,0> a[32][depth] = 
```
can be changed to:
```c
static int a[32][depth] = 
```

## Intefaces
The arguments of the top-level function in an HLS component are synthesized into interfaces and ports that group multiple signals to define the communication protocol between the HLS component and elements external to the design. The tool defines interfaces automatically, using industry standards to specify the protocol used. The type of interfaces that the tool chooses depends on the data type and direction of the parameters of the top-level function, the target flow for the HLS component, the default interface configuration settings as described in Interface Configuration, and any specified **INTERFACE** pragmas or directives.

### Interfaces for Vitis Kernel Flow

The Vitis kernel flow provides support for compiled kernel objects (.xo) for software control from a host application and by the Xilinx Runtime (XRT). As described in PL Kernel Properties in the Vitis Unified Software Platform Documentation , this flow has very specific interface requirements that Vitis HLS must meet.

Vitis HLS supports memory, stream, and register interface paradigms where each paradigm follows a certain interface protocol and uses the adapter to communicate with the external world.
- Memory Paradigm (**m_axi**): the data is accessed by the kernel through memory such as DDR, HBM, PLRAM/BRAM/URAM
- Stream Paradigm (**axis**): the data is streamed into the kernel from another streaming source, such as video processor or another kernel, and can also be streamed out of the kernel.
- Register Paradigm (**s_axilite**): The data is accessed by the kernel through register interfaces and accessed by software as register reads/writes.

### Interfaces for Vivado IP Flow

The Vivado IP flow supports a wide variety of I/O protocols and handshakes due to the requirement of supporting FPGA design for a wide variety of applications. This flow supports a traditional system design flow where multiple IP are integrated into a system. IP can be generated through Vitis HLS. In this IP flow there are two modes of control for execution of the system:
- Software Control: The system is controlled through a software application running on an embedded Arm processor or external x86 processor, using drivers to access elements of the hardware design, and reading and writing registers in the hardware to control the execution of IP in the system.
- Self Synchronous: In this mode the IP exposes signals which are used for starting and stopping the kernel. These signals are driven by other IP or other elements of the system design that handles the execution of the IP.

The Vivado IP flow supports **memory**, **stream**, and **register** interface paradigms where each paradigm supports **different interface protocols** to communicate with the external world, as shown in the following table. Note that while the Vitis kernel flow supports only the AXI4 interface adapters, this flow supports a number of different interface types.

<div class="caption">
  Interface types
</div>

The default interfaces are defined by the C-argument type in the top-level function, and the default paradigm, as shown in the following table.
![default-interfaces](../../../../public/images/posts/2024/2024-07-31-vitis-hls/default-interfaces.png){: style="height: 250px; margin: 0 auto;"}
<div class="caption">
  Default interfaces
</div>

The default **execution mode** for Vivado IP flow is **sequential execution**, which requires the HLS IP to complete one iteration before starting the next. This is specified by the **ap_ctrl_hs** block control protocol. The control protocol can be changed as specified in **Block-Level Control Protocols**.

The vadd function in the following code provides an example of interface synthesis in the Vivado IP flow.
```c
#define VDATA_SIZE 16

typedef struct v_datatype { unsigned int data[VDATA_SIZE]; } v_dt;

extern "C" {
void vadd(const v_dt* in1, // Read-Only Vector 1
          const v_dt* in2, // Read-Only Vector 2
          v_dt* out_r, // Output Result for Addition
          const unsigned int size // Size in integer 
) {

   unsigned int vSize = ((size - 1) / VDATA_SIZE) + 1;

   // Auto-pipeline is going to apply pipeline to this loop
   vadd1:
   for (int i = 0; i < vSize; i++) {
      vadd2:
      for (int k = 0; k < VDATA_SIZE; k++) {
         out_r[i].data[k] = in1[i].data[k] + in2[i].data[k];
      }
   }
}
}
```

The vadd function includes:

- Two pointer inputs: in1 and in2
- A pointer: out_r that the results are written to
- A scalar value size

In the **default** Vivado IP flow the tool creates three types of interface ports on the RTL design to handle the flow of both data and control.

- Clock and Reset ports: **ap_clk** and **ap_rst** are added to the kernel.
- Block-level control protocol: The **ap_ctrl** interface is implemented as an **s_axilite** interface.
- Port-level interface protocols: These are created for each argument in the top-level function and the function return (if the function returns a value). **As explained in the table above most of the arguments use a port protocol of ap_none, and so have no control signals.** In the vadd example above these ports include: in1, in2, and size. However, the out_r_o output port uses the ap_vld protocol and so is associated with the out_r_o_ap_vld signal.

## AXI Adapter Interface Protocols

As discussed in Interfaces for Vitis Kernel Flow, the AXI4 adapter interfaces are the default interfaces used by Vitis HLS for the Vitis Application Acceleration Development flow, though they are also supported in the Vivado IP flow.

The AXI4 interfaces supported by Vitis HLS include the AXI4-Stream interface (axis), AXI4-Lite (s_axilite), and AXI4 master (m_axi) interfaces.

**m_axi**

Specify on **arrays** and **pointers** (and references in C++) only. The m_axi mode specifies an AXI4 **Memory** Mapped interface.

> Tip: You can group bundle arguments into a single m_axi interface.

**s_axilite**

Specify this protocol on any type of argument except streams. The s_axilite mode specifies an AXI4-Lite slave interface.

> Tip: You can bundle multiple arguments into a single s_axilite interface.

**axis**

Specify this protocol on input arguments or output arguments only, not on input/output arguments. The axis mode specifies an AXI4-**Stream** interface.

> Tip: The AXI protocol requires an active-Low reset. If your design uses AXI interfaces the tool will define this reset level with a warning if the syn.rtl.reset_level is active-High, which is the default setting.

### AXI4-Stream
#### [How AXI4-Stream is Implemented](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls/How-AXI4-Stream-is-Implemented)
AXI4-Stream is a protocol designed for transporting **arbitrary unidirectional data**. In an AXI4-Stream, **TDATA** width of bits is transferred per clock cycle. The transfer is started once the producer sends the **TVALID** signal and the consumer responds by sending the **TREADY** signal (once it has consumed the initial TDATA). At this point, the producer will start sending TDATA and **TLAST** (TUSER if needed to carry additional user-defined sideband data). TLAST signals the last byte of the stream. So the consumer keeps consuming the incoming TDATA until TLAST is asserted.

If your design requires a streaming interface begin by defining and using a streaming data structure like **hls::stream** in Vitis HLS. This simple object encapsulates the requirements of streaming and its streaming interface is by default implemented in the RTL as a FIFO interface (**ap_fifo**) but can be optionally, implemented as a handshake interface (**ap_hs**) or an **AXI4-Stream** interface (**axis**).

If a AXI4-Stream interface (axis) is specified via the interface pragma mode option, the interface implementation will mimic the style of an AXIS interface by defining the TDATA, TVALID and TREADY signals.

If a more formal AXIS implementation is desired, then Vitis HLS requires the usage of a special data type (hls::axis defined in **ap_axi_sdata.h**) to encapsulate the requirements of the AXI4-Stream protocol and implement the special RTL signals needed for this interface.

The AXI4-Stream interface is implemented as a struct type in Vitis HLS and has the following signature (defined in ap_axi_sdata.h):

**template <typename T, size_t WUser, size_t WId, size_t WDest> struct axis { .. };**

Where:

- T: The data type to be streamed. This can support any data type, including ap_fixed.
- WUser: Width of the TUSER signal
- WId: Width of the TID signal
- WDest: Width of the TDest signal

For example:
```c
hls::axis<ap_int<WData>, WUser, WId, WDest>

hls::axis<ap_uint<WData>, WUser, WId, WDest>
```

It can be further simplified as:
```c
ap_axis<Wdata, WUser, WId, WDest>

ap_axiu<Wdata, WUser, WId, WDest>
```


#### [AXI4-Stream Interfaces without Side-Channels](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls/AXI4-Stream-Interfaces-without-Side-Channels)
An AXI4-Stream is used without side-channels when the function argument, ap_axis or ap_axiu data type, does not contain any AXI4 side-channel elements (that is, when the WUser, WId, and WDest parameters are set to 0). In the following example, both interfaces are implemented using an AXI4-Stream:
```c
#include "ap_axi_sdata.h"
#include "hls_stream.h"

typedef ap_axiu<32, 0, 0, 0> trans_pkt;

void example(hls::stream< trans_pkt > &A, hls::stream< trans_pkt > &B)
{
#pragma HLS INTERFACE mode=axis port=A
#pragma HLS INTERFACE mode=axis port=B
    trans_pkt tmp;
    A.read(tmp);
    tmp.data += 5;
    B.write(tmp);
}
```

After synthesis, both arguments are implemented with a data port (TDATA) and the standard AXI4-Stream protocol ports, TVALID, TREADY, TKEEP, TLAST, and TSTRB, as shown in the following figure.

![axi4-stream-wo-sc](../../../../public/images/posts/2024/2024-07-31-vitis-hls/axi4-stream-wo-sc.png){: style="height: 200px; margin: 0 auto;"}
<div class="caption">
    AXI4-Stream Interfaces without Side-Channels
</div>

>  If you specify an hls::stream object with a data type other than ap_axis or ap_axiu, the tool will infer an AXI4-Stream interface without the TLAST signal, or any of the side-channel signals. This implementation of the AXI4-Stream interface consumes fewer device resources, but offers no visibility into when the stream is ending.

Multiple variables can be combined into the same AXI4-Stream interface by using a struct, which is aggregated by Vitis HLS by default. Aggregating the elements of a struct into a single wide-vector, allows all elements of the struct to be implemented in the same AXI4-Stream interface.

#### [AXI4-Stream Interfaces with Side-Channels](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls/AXI4-Stream-Interfaces-with-Side-Channels?tocId=66_J6r2PEhfxupRb0AV3Qg)
The following example shows how the side-channels can be used directly in the C/C++ code and implemented on the interface. The code uses #include "ap_axi_sdata.h" to provide an API to handle the side-channels of the AXI4-Stream interface. In the following example a signed 32-bit data type is used:
```c
#include "ap_axi_sdata.h"
#include "ap_int.h"
#include "hls_stream.h"

#define DWIDTH 32

typedef ap_axiu<DWIDTH, 1, 1, 1> trans_pkt;

extern "C"{
    void krnl_stream_vmult(hls::stream<trans_pkt> &A, 
						   hls::stream<trans_pkt> &B) {
#pragma HLS INTERFACE mode=axis port=A
#pragma HLS INTERFACE mode=axis port=B
#pragma HLS INTERFACE mode=s_axilite port=return bundle=control
        bool eos = false;
        
        vmult: do {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
            trans_pkt t2 = A.read();
            
            // Packet for Output
            trans_pkt t_out;
            
            // Reading data from input packet
            ap_uint<DWIDTH> in2 = t2.data;
            ap_uint<DWIDTH> tmpOut = in2 * 5;

            // Setting data and configuration to output packet
            t_out.data = tmpOut;
            t_out.last = t2.last;
            t_out.keep = -1; //Enabling all bytes
            // Writing packet to output stream
            B.write(t_out);
            if (t2.last) {
               eos = true;
            }
        } while (eos == false);
    }
}
```

After synthesis, both the A and B arguments are implemented with data ports, the standard AXI4-Stream protocol ports, TVALID and TREADY and all of the optional ports described in the struct.
